BACKGROUND: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The internet's beloved NyanCat is lost in space after his ship crashed on a deserted planet, sending all of his packed belongings spiraling into the infinite abyss! But Nyan Cat needs to get home. To do so, he must collect 15 space crystals to create a portal that will safely teleport him home! The journey won't be easy though. Nyan Cat must carefully traverse around floating asteroids. If he collides with an asteroid, he will lose health (HP), and a precious crystal will be lost! Luckily, Nyan Cat always comes prepared and packed some apples and fish for fuel! Apples will increase his stamina, but if he hasn't eaten, he will lose HP! Maxing out his stamina points will allow Nyan Cat to withstand the damage of ONE asteroid. If he comes across any fish and eats it, he will become *TEMPORARILY* super strong and *ALMOST* invincible (he will still need fuel...), easily breaking through the asteroids without suffering a scratch (you'll know he's become INVINCIBLE when he has a flashing color effect)! Will you help Nyan Cat find his way back home?
